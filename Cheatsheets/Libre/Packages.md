# Introduction

The aim of this simple "guide" is to present most of the (best) software I have found that works on Linux, though most of them also run on other platforms. Oh, and they are all FSF approved (libre software if you don't know what FSF is). Try the software and give it a spin to see if it suites your needs. Also, here goes a disclaimer: I am by no means an expert in most of the software listed below, however, the time I have used has proven to be more than pleasant and productive; the only requirement I ask from the program in question is for it to be great for power users.

Also note that some programs may fit several categories listed below. I will list it were I feel it suites best.

## Linux/BSD/Illumos distributions

### Stability wise

These distributions are mostly based on the premise of delivering a stable experience. However, this does not mean you are bounded to use only _stable_ software. Some distributions allow you to use newer software, such as Alpine (community repo), OpenSUSE (Tumbleweed), MX Linux (Debian backports and testing), NetBSD (current branch), FreeBSD (current branch).

* [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/): a small muslc based distribution focused on embedded systems and servers. It has stable releases and a rolling model.

* [Devuan Linux](https://devuan.org/): Debian without systemd, and it has extended support. A more user friendly solution, geared towards the desktop, would be [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/).

* [OpenSUSE Linux](https://www.opensuse.org/): usually forgotten, however, one of the best distributions out there. [GeckoLinux](https://geckolinux.github.io/): is a more user friendly solution based on OpenSUSE.

* [CentOS Linux](https://www.centos.org/): the community version of RHEL. It is the most stable distribution out there, also the one that ages the most. It is widely used at CERN and FERMI. With CentOS 8 release, there is a new way to get officially supported software faster, see CentOS Streams.

* [OpenIndiana Illumos](https://www.openindiana.org/): based on Illumos, the descendant of OpenSolaris; it targets workstations and servers, and it is kept somewhat up to date. There is also [OMNI OS](https://omniosce.org/), which is better suited for servers.

* [NetBSD](http://netbsd.org/): targets embedded systems, yet it is a joy to use it, simple and _hacky._

* [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) and [DragonflyBSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/).

---

### More dynamic distributions and OSs, mostly targeting desktops

* [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/): a DIY distribution: offers glibc and muslc libraries, systemd-free, yet powerful and follows a rolling release model, supports various archs.

* See [OpenSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed). See [Devuan](https://devuan.org/) with Ceres repositories.

* [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/): Arch-based OpenRC/Runit distribution.

* [KDE Neon Linux](https://neon.kde.org/download): Ubuntu-based KDE focused distribution. It is officially developed by the KDE team. It is however, based on Ubuntu-LTS.

* [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/): RedHat backed distro which focuses on more up-to-date software.

* [GuixSD](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/): a fully libre distribution centered arround the Guix package/system manager.

## Terminal applications

No "low level" utilities will be listed below, just the programs that you will find yourself dealing directly, this means no mention to tar, grep, awk, sed, cups, gvfs, etc. However, they are all wonderful programs.

### Shell

* [Mksh](https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm): it is one of the fastest, smallest yet featureful shells available. It runs pretty much anywhere. It is the default shell in Android.

### Helpers

* [Abduco](https://github.com/martanne/abduco) and [dvtm](https://github.com/martanne/dvtm): created by the same person, [Marc Andr√® Tanner](https://github.com/martanne). Abduco provides session management within the terminal. Dvtm is a terminal multiplexer. Combined, they provide the same functionality as [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) or [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), GNU Screen or Tmux are also very nice multiplexers, and you are encouraged to try them.

### System tools

* [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch): prints system information directly to the terminal with a nice logo. Use [Inxi](https://github.com/smxi/inxi) if you would like a richer output.

* [Lm_sensors](https://github.com/groeck/lm-sensors): monitor temperatures, control fans, etc.

* [Bluez](http://www.bluez.org/): bluetooth management. If a graphical user interface is being used, then [Blueman](https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman) will be of great help.

* [Udisks](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks): mount and unmount drives or volumes with no difficulties.

* [Vifm](https://vifm.info/): vi-like file manager, simple yet complete with some nifty features. [Ranger](https://ranger.github.io/): complete file manager in the terminal, even with fancy columns, etc; and it is fully customizable! Another file manager would be [Midnight Commander (mc)](https://midnight-commander.org/). If a much lighter alternative is wanted [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn#file-handling) is also wonderful. There is [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) too, which is a disk usage analizer.

* [Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/): an outstanding file transfer utility. It is mainly targeted towards incremental transfers. It is mainly used for backup or complex copying.

* [Borg](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg): as it says in it's description: Deduplicating archiver with compression and authenticated encryption. It works wonders for backups. A similar tool would be [Restic](https://restic.net/).

* [Atool](http://www.nongnu.org/atool/): a multi-format archiver and extractor.

#### Power management

* [Rtorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent): powerful torrent management utility. I recommend using [Pyroscope's extended distribution](https://github.com/pyroscope/rtorrent-ps). If a GUI is needed then [Qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) or [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) are available with optional terminal backends.

* [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/): extensible and powerful IRC client. There are extensions to expand its compatibility with other protocols.

## Extras

Here goes a little extra section regarding some of the technologies that I quite like but are not suitable for the previous sections.

### RTOS and microkernels

* [FreeRTOS](https://freertos.org/): the world-wide-know libre RTOS.

* [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/): a modern and versatile RTOS, under the Linux Foundation umbrella.

* [SeL4](https://sel4.systems/): a robust microkernel OS.

* [RTEMS](http://rtems.com/): an open RTOS for high performance.

* [NuttX](http://www.nuttx.org/): a small footprint RTOS.

### Programming languages

* **C** [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/): the low level language. The grandfather of the modern world. A wonder in itself, by it's simplicity and flexibility. If an in-depth analysis of the code is required, there is [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com). A C compiler targeted to more retro/microcontroller CPUs is [Small Device C Compiler](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).

* **Modern C++** [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/): please, use the modern features the language gives you! Low level language, though several times more complete (*and dificult* when it comes to learning it) than C.

* **Fortran** [GNU Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/): though it may seem outdated, it is still widely used in HPC and older software for its unmatched speed.

* [Ada/Spark](https://www.adacore.com/community): high-performance security critical programming language. It is not widely used in the *libre* software world, but it definitely has owned its place in the industry.

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/): a higher level language that C/C++ yet it targets low level systems. It's main focus is on memory security.

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/): a language targeted towards high performant code, specially analisys and science.

* **Lisp/Scheme** [Sbcl](http://www.sbcl.org/), [GNU Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) or [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/): just learn it.

* [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/): a wonderful little language geared specially towards embedding.

* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/): functional language built on top of the ErlangVM (BEAM). It is mostly targeted to fault tolerance systems and web services with scalability in mind. Much recommended. [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo) is a static analyzer for it.

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/): _the_ functional language.

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/): a language mainly aimed at statistics. [Rkward](https://rkward.kde.org/Main_Page) is a small and lightweight, IDE for it. [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/): is the most complete and well-known IDE for R.

* [F#](https://fsharp.org/): functional meets .NET.

* [UML Umbrello](https://umbrello.kde.org/): UML diagramming/modeller.

* **Formal languages** [F*](https://www.fstar-lang.org/) and [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

* **Go** [Gcc-go](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccgo/) or [Go](https://golang.org/): developed by Google, for the web, great for backends or anything related to web.

* **Prolog** [Gprolog](http://gprolog.org/) or [SWI Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/): the greatest logical language out there.

* [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/): a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

* **Hardware description languages:** [GHDL](http://ghdl.free.fr/): VHDL compiler. [Iverilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/): Verilog compiler. I greatly recommend [Alliance](https://www-soc.lip6.fr/equipe-cian/logiciels/alliance/) as an integrated environment. See [Opencircuitdesign](http://opencircuitdesign.com/) for more solutions.

* **Others worth looking at:** [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/): language for formal verification. [Python](https://www.python.org/) quick scriptable and widely used language (specially in science), [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) is a compiler for it.

* **General tools:** [Crucible](https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible): library for symbolic simulation of imperative programs. [SAW-Script](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script): scripting language for SAW (Software Analysis Workbench).

#### Web

As a recommendation, use javascript only where necesary and sparsely.

* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/): make yourself a favour and use it instead of JavaScript. There is also [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) if you prefer the Haskell way.

* **Transpilers to JavaScript:** [Rust Yew](https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew), the goodness of Rust in all of its glory (targets WASM). [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/): modern language to create reliable webapps (front-end). [Go GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs): compiler form Go to JavaScript.

* [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/): there are quite a few frameworks out there, but Phoenix, written in Elixir, is definitely the best one out there; complete and flexible. Another framework that I personally like too is [Lapis](http://leafo.net/lapis/), for Lua and Moonscript.

##### Infraestructure

* [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/): web interface to your servers.

* HTTP Caching: [Varnish Cache](https://varnish-cache.org/index.html).

* See: [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Saltstack](https://www.saltstack.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Rancher](https://rancher.com/).

* **Static site builders:** [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/): same, but with Rust, preferred by author. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): great(est) static pages generator, Go based. [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/): an alternative based on Haskell.

* **Extra bits, none Open Source** [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/): as its name implies, simple, yet complete domain acquisition service with Let's Encrypt certificates, plus they fully support open source. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): complete hosting solution, one of the easiest and complete ones. [UpCloud](https://www.upcloud.com/): another nice hosting solution. See also: [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/world/). If the Illumos route is preferred, then there is [MNX](https://mnx.io/pricing/).

### Databases

* [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): a lightweight SQL solution.

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): extremely powerful, and a tad complex ORDBMS.

* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/): MySQL compatible (forked) solution widely used in the industry.

* [Redis](https://redis.io/): in-memory storage, there are interfaces for every language imaginable.

### Social Media, communication platforms

* [LibrePay](https://liberapay.com/): similar to Patreon. One can donate to individuals, projects, companies or be given money for ones work.

* [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/): twitter like network, but decentralized and several times better (btw, you don't _tweet,_ you **toot**). Mastodon is based on [GNU Social](https://gnu.io/social/), which is also great, and it is compatible with it. Another alternative compatible with the OStatus systems (*Gnu Social and Mastodon*) is [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social), which is written in Elixir.

* [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en/): decentralized video hosting network.

* [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/home/): _An open network for secure, decentralized communication._ I personally hope they get this straight and become the dominant network/system. [Diaspora*](https://diasporafoundation.org/) is another wonderful social network following the same principle.

* [Wire](https://wire.com/en/): a _collaboration_ network, similar to Slack or Telegram, but much leaner. There is also [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.org/), which is a lot more _enterprisy,_ so up to you.

* **VoIP:** [Mumble](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page): simple and lightweight VoIP. [Jami](https://jami.net/): a wonderful alternative to the likes of Skype. Another solution which runs directly in the browser is [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/), and it is fully feature too, which makes it even better. 

* [GNU FM (Libre FM)](https://gnu.io/fm/): relative of GNU Social, but directed for music streaming.

### Project management

* **Git**: [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-US/): self-hosted Git. Similar to Github; and much lighter than [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), which is a more complete solution, and it is used by major companies and projects. If the solution has to be simple and responsive, there is [Cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/) plus [Gitolite](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/). Another simple yet featureful solution is [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/), which is starting to be my favourite.

* **Project management:** [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/): complete ERP and CRM solution, the open-source version does not have the most advance (and usually handy) tools. [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/): complete ERP solution. [SuiteCRM](https://suitecrm.com/): complete CRM solution.

* **Project management (code-based):** [Tuleap](https://www.tuleap.org/), complete software solution for any project. [Phabricator](https://phacility.com/) is a _down to the code_ alternative.
